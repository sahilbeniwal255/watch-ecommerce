        <p>A return policy outlines the rules and conditions for returning purchased items. Typically, it includes details about eligibility, timeframes, refund methods, and whether returns are free or require shipping fees. Some policies allow returns within 30 days, while others might have stricter guidelines. Items must usually be unused and in original packaging. Certain items, like personalized or perishable goods, may be non-returnable. Refunds can be issued as store credit, exchanges, or back to the original payment method. Always check a companyâ€™s specific policy before purchasing to avoid misunderstandings</p>
